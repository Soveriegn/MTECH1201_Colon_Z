Bugs:
    Screen goes full orange without showing the bee
    On game over you cannot restart
    Circles will overlap at times

Improvements:
    Make bug or character animate minimally (legs move back and forth)
    Make death png of squashed bug or character
    Make animation or sprite for death of squashed bug or character
    Add audio que for game over
    Add audio for game start
    Add audio for going into circles
    Add audio for ambience
    Add audio for entering the circle
    Create start menu
    Create restart button
    Create quit game sequence and button
    Change button map to include W,A,S,D
    Have obstacles move
Code: 

// Define graphic as a global variable. This variable
// will be the offscreen buffer.
let graphic;

let gameState = "START";

function setup() {
  describe(
    'Black canvas with a very dark grey rectangle in the middle. When the cursor is hovered over the canvas, a white circle follows the cursor in the black areas of the canvas, but not over the dark grey rectangle.'
  );
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

  // Create the graphic that will be placed within the canvas.
  graphic = createGraphics(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
  if (gameState === "START") {
    startScreen();
  } else if (gameState === "TRANSITION") {
    gameScreen();
  } else if (gameState === "GAME") {
    gameScreen();
  } else if (gameState === "END") {
    endScreen();
  }


  // Create a black rectangle to cover the canvas.
  // Make the rectangle black with an alpha value of 12 so that
  // the white circle following the cursor slowly fades into the background.
  background(0, 12);

  // Create the circle that will follow the cursor as it hovers
  // over the canvas.
  //Zack Dev Notes: Elipse settings when on black area of canvas
  fill(255);
  noStroke();
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30);

  // Give the buffer a dark grey background.
  // Any shapes within the buffer will have no fill.
  graphic.background(51);
  //Zack Dev Notes: The Elipse on the grey canvas settings
  graphic.noFill();

  // When the cursor hovers over the offscreen buffer, replicate the
  // circle that is drawn when the cursor is hovering over the
  // canvas. Within the buffer area, only show the outline of the circle.
  //Zack Dev Notes: The Elipse on the grey canvas settings
  graphic.stroke(255);
  // OG Line of code:graphic.ellipse(mouseX - 150, mouseY - 75, 60, 60);
  graphic.ellipse(mouseX + 0, mouseY + 0, 30, 30);

  // Draw the buffer to the screen with image().
  //image(graphic, 150, 75);
  image(graphic, 0, 0);
}

// function resetSketch() {
//   // This function is called by the testing suite to reset the sketch.
//   // It is empty because there is no state to reset in this sketch. 
//   // However, if there were variables that needed to be reset, this
//   // would be the place to do it. For example, if there were a
//   // counter variable that incremented each time the mouse was pressed,
//   // you would reset it to zero here.
//   // counter = 0;
// }

!Bee walking:  png sequence, counter ++ for increment, above it counter modulo 4 = which will create sequence for if statement for the different states for bee anim.
Use if not else if and else at end if needed. 
Use image graphic to put image on screen. Put graphic top corner. 
Use functions to silo code and have each states coding actions.
