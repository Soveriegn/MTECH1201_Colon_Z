Audio Visualizer Program
    Concept:
        Looking at the examples of what we were doing in class I want to create an audio visualizer. I want something similiar
        to the way the worm moves in our in class examples but that it responds to the music in the background. 
    Brief:
        The visualization part matters second to the audio working and is dependent on the beat of the song. It can be done one of 
        two ways I can have the audio itsewlf infleunce the visualization
    Psudeo Code/Reference/Planning: 
    Classes:
        Waves
        Particles
    Notes:
        Syncing
        Amplitudes at different frequenceies p5.waveform and p5.fft (will spit out different frequenceies for visualization)
        Interactive Music video different things happeing at different parts of the song.Give user agecny and change task based
        on different parts of the song. Third array as multiplier which increases and then decreases back to what it was. Look into 
        check back into sound file for whereever you are in the song and use states to tranistion between different elements. Keep
        aall elements until end of song.
